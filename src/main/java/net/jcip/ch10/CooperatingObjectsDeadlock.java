/**
 * Consider the cooperating classes in {@link CooperatingObjectsDeadlock}, which might be used in a taxicab dispatching application.
 * {@link Taxi} represents an individual taxi with a location and a destination; {@link Dispatcher} represents a fleet of taxis.
 * <p>
 * While no method explicitly acquires two locks, callers of setLocation and getImage can acquire two locks just the same. If a
 * thread calls setLocation in response to an update from a GPS receiver, it first updates the taxiâ€™s location and then checks to
 * see if it has reached its destination. If it has, it informs the dispatcher that it needs a new destination. Since both
 * setLocation and notifyAvailable are synchronized, the thread calling setLocation acquires the Taxi lock and then the Dispatcher
 * lock. Similarly, a thread calling getImage acquires the Dispatcher lock and then each Taxi lock (one at at time).
 * <p>
 * Just as in LeftRightDeadlock, two locks are acquired by two threads in different orders, risking deadlock. It was easy to spot
 * the deadlock possibility in LeftRightDeadlock or transferMoney by looking for methods that acquire two locks. Spotting the
 * deadlock possibility in Taxi and Dispatcher is a little harder: the warning sign is that an alien method is being called while
 * holding a lock.
 * <p>
 * Invoking an alien method with a lock held is asking for liveness trouble. The alien method might acquire other locks (risking
 * deadlock) or block for an unexpectedly long time, stalling other threads that need the lock you hold.
