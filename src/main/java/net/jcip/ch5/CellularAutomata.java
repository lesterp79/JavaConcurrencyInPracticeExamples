/**
 * {@link CellularAutomata} demonstrates using a barrier to compute a cellular automata simulation, such as Conwayâ€™s Life game
 * (Gardner, 1970).
 * <p>
 * When parallelizing a simulation, it is generally impractical to assign a separate thread to each element (in the case of Life, a
 * cell); this would require too many threads, and the overhead of coordinating them would dwarf the computation. Instead, it makes
 * sense to partition the problem into a number of sub-parts, let each thread solve a sub-part, and then merge the results.
 * <p>
 * {@link CellularAutomata} partitions the board into N-cpu parts, where N-cpu is the number of CPUs available, and assigns each
 * part to a thread. At each step, the worker threads calculate new values for all the cells in their part of the board.
 * <p>
 * When all worker threads have reached the barrier, the barrier action commits the new values to the data model. After  the barrier
 * action runs, the worker threads are released to compute the next step of the calculation, which includes consulting an isDone
 * method to determine whether further iterations are required.`
